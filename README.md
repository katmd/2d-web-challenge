# Holocene Code Challenge

Creates a front end web application which renders a 2-dimensional array of data in both table and chart form.

## Setup

To run this application, copy or clone this repo to your machine. Then, install the packages:

`npm install`

Then run the following command:

`npm run start`

Navigate to the local host port noted by webpack to view the rendered program (defaults to http://localhost:8080/ if available).

## User Functionality

Change the data represented by the x-axis by selecting a different header in the table.

Swap between a Line graph view and a Bar graph view by using the buttons above the graph.

Add custom data to the dataset by submitting the data form.
